Internet of Things (IoT) conceptualizes the idea of remotely connecting and monitoring real world objects (things) through the Internet [1]. When it comes to our house, this concept can be aptly incorporated to make it smarter, safer and automated. This IoT project focuses on building a smart wireless home security system which sends alerts to the owner by using Internet in case of any trespass and raises an alarm optionally. Besides, the same can also be utilized for home automation by making use of the same set of sensors. The leverage obtained by prefering this system over the similar kinds of existing systems is that the alerts and the status sent by the wifi connected microcontroller managed system can be received by the user on his phone from any distance irrespective of whether his mobile phone is connected to the internet. The microcontroller used in the current prototype is the TI-CC3200 Launchpad board which comes with an embedded micro-controller and an onboard Wi-Fi shield making use of which all the elctrical appliances inside the home can be controlled and managed.
